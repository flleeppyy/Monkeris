changes:
  - rscadd: Shields now trigger their raised state when blocking instead of when
      walking. The slowdown is preserved.
  - rscadd: bucklers and other non-riot shields can now be raised.
  - tweak: Adds three shield-related gameplay tips
  - balance: Adjusts the balance of many shields to work with being raised
  - bugfix: removes unused shield code in human_defense.dm that was causing 
      runtimes whenever someone attacked a raised shield
  - code_imp: moved some blocking related vars up to /mob.
