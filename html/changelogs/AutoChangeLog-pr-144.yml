changes:
  - rscadd: Double Tact weapons now automatically start raising after being 
      swung, reducing the number of clicks needed for repeat attacks
  - tweak: made Robustness's stat description slightly more accurate.
  - balance: double_tact weapons now take slightly longer to swing, using a 
      short windup period that is affected by the ROB stat.
  - bugfix: do_afters no longer ignore the state of the "immobile" arg if their 
      user is also the target
  - bugfix: you no longer keep raising nothing after dropping a double tact 
      weapon
  - code_imp: moves the handling for only 1 do_after at a time on tools to 
      do_after itself, handled by the "unique" arg
  - refactor: double_tact() now splits into the start_tact and end_tact procs, 
      which can also be called pretty much anywhere to affect the current item's
      tact state
