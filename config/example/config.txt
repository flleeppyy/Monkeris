# You can use the @ character at the beginning of a config option to lock it from being edited in-game
# Example usage:
# @SERVERNAME tgstation
# Which sets the SERVERNAME, and disallows admins from being able to change it using View Variables.
# @LOG_TWITTER 0
# Which explicitly disables LOG_TWITTER, as well as locking it.
# There are various options which are hard-locked for security reasons.

# Hashtags at the beginning of lines will not be parsed. This only applies at the beginning of the line.
# If you include a hashtag in a setting like so: MYHEXCOLORCONFIG #FF73D2
# It will still be parsed

## Server name: This appears at the top of the screen in-game. In this case it will read "tgstation: station_name" where station_name is the randomly generated name of the station for the round. Remove the # infront of SERVERNAME and replace 'spacestation13' with the name of your choice

## Uncomment to set the number of /world/Reboot()s before the DreamDaemon restarts itself. 0 means restart every round. Requires tgstation server tools.
#ROUNDS_UNTIL_HARD_RESTART 10

## Unhash this entry to have certain jobs require your account to be at least a certain number of days old to select. You can configure the exact age requirement for different jobs by editing
## the minimal_player_age variable in the files in folder /code/game/jobs/job/.. for the job you want to edit. Set minimal_player_age to 0 to disable age requirement for that job.
## REQUIRES the database set up to work. Keep it hashed if you don't have a database set up.
## NOTE: If you have just set-up the database keep this DISABLED, as player age is determined from the first time they connect to the server with the database up. If you just set it up, it means
## you have noone older than 0 days, since noone has been logged yet. Only turn this on once you have had the database up for 30 days.
#USE_AGE_RESTRICTION_FOR_JOBS

## Unhash this entry to have certain antag roles require your account to be at least a certain number of days old for round start and auto-spawn selection.
## Non-automatic antagonist recruitment, such as being converted to cultism is not affected. Has the same database requirements and notes as USE_AGE_RESTRICTION_FOR_JOBS.
#USE_AGE_RESTRICTION_FOR_ANTAGS

## Unhash this to use recursive explosions, keep it hashed to use circle explosions. Recursive explosions react to walls, airlocks and blast doors, making them look a lot cooler than the boring old circular explosions. They require more CPU and are (as of january 2013) experimental

## Leave this commented out to use the values defined in the job datums. Values in the datums are stored as minutes.
#USE_EXP_RESTRICTIONS_HEADS_HOURS 3
## Unhash this to change head jobs' playtime requirements so that they're based on department playtime, rather than crew playtime.
USE_EXP_RESTRICTIONS_HEADS_DEPARTMENT
## Unhash this to enable playtime requirements for certain non-head jobs, like Engineer and Scientist.
#USE_EXP_RESTRICTIONS_OTHER
## Allows admins to bypass job playtime requirements.
#USE_EXP_RESTRICTIONS_ADMIN_BYPASS
## Unhash this to have intern tags automatically added to ID cards for station roles depending on the living hours of the player holding them.
#USE_LOW_LIVING_HOUR_INTERN
## If USE_LOW_LIVING_HOUR_INTERN is unhashed, players under this number of living hours have [Intern] added to their ID card. If this isn't set, uses USE_EXP_RESTRICTIONS_HEADS_HOURS instead. If that isn't set, it finally defaults to a hardcoded fallback of 15 hours.
